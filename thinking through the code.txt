compare incoming to current [l-1]
If incoming is larger, array.push incoming
If incoming is smaller, compare to [0]
	If incoming is smaller array.insert[0, incoming]
	else if incoming is larger than [0], compare to half way
		[((l-1)/2).to_i]
		if equal insert[(((l-1)/2)+1).to_i, incoming]
		elsif larger, compare to 3/4 of way
			[((l-1)*.75).to_i]

		elsif smaller, compare to 1/4 way
			[((l-1)*.25).to_i]
