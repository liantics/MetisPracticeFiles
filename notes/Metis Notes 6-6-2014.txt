Metis Notes 6-6-2014

What did I wish I know when I started

- don't panic
- watch out for your thoughts: it's not you, this stuff is hard.

Imagine you're pulling someone over to explain to them what you're trying to do. "Rubber ducking"

Hammock driven development

Getting Hired
- google your name
BLOG the heck out of your experience in Metis, tweet it, tuumblr it, etc. 
- include the cool things you've learned, problems solved

Get at least 3 ruby friends outside this group. Join Boston Ruby Group. A useful means of building your network. Be a little selfish - WASTE people's time. Everyone has been in the situation we're in right now. You can pay it back later. "What are you working on? Can I watch?" Ask questions. Go early, hang around the food. Have no shame. 

Use the docs all the time

Dash = documentation viewer app. Can download the standard library documentation

twitter is the best way to keep connected with coders. Tweet to people!
