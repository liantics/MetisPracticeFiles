You can find out what classes a class inherits by calling "ancestors" on the class name

Array map method.

Will iterate over an array, pass each element in the array into a block, then return a new array in which each element is the result of the action of the block.

@input.to_a.each_with_index do |line, index| #<------- .to_a puts it into an array, also returns index
# NOTES: 
#two ways to do the map on this:
#students, chairs = line.split(" ").map { |element| element.to_i }
#And
#shortcut notation, for when there is ONE element, and ONE method being called
# on that element:
#students, chairs = line.split(" ").map(&:to_i)	
#Shortcut works for ONE element, ONE method
#If it's more complicated, it must be written out the long way

The challeneges are the kinds of things we'll see in interviews

----------
Moving on to Web Development
Tomorrow, will cover templating
Today: storing the data from our templates
_________

Storing our Data - our picture gallery app has:

Object 1: Galleries
Attributes: 
- name


Object 2: Images
Attributes:
- name
- description
- image_content

--- 
In our prework app, we had 2 galleries

Gallery

Images

Note: may have to run the elephant postgres app in order for these to work:

Starting postgres sql (postgresql), enter:

psql 

in terminal.

Display a database when psql is running, enter: 

\d

in terminal

----------
SQL commands:

SELECT specifies which attributes to get
FROM tells you which table to get the attributes from
WHERE specifies a filter


----------------

Combining two tables: do a JOIN on specific attribute from each table
